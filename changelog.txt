Version: 0.3.1176
Date: 2023-02-26

  Features:
    - If neither Mower or Dectorio mods are active there are now mod settings that can be
      separately enabled. They are not present with either mod as these mods already present the
      same functionality to a degree. These settings allow you to optionally:
        - Remove dead biters and tree stomps
        - Remove nasty biter goo they leave behind in their bases
        - Remove all other decoratives (shrubbery, mud, rocky texture)
